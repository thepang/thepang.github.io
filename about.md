  A professional writer is an amateur who didn't quit.

Hi, I'm Pang.

I am definitely an amateur writer and I haven't yet quit, so I suppose that makes me a pro. Follow me on my journey as I work through the Metis Data Science Boot Camp.

Who knows, maybe I'll like it so much I keep this going.

Below is some stuff from the template that I felt should keep on for those who come upon this site.


In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
